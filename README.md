# A* Pathfinding Application in Java and Python

Pathfinding is the methodology of finding the shortest route from point A to point B. It is highly prevalent in robotics and autonomous driving.

In this example, I have created a Python implementation using PyGame. The explanation and code was adapted from what was provided in the video by Tech With Tim (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A). Further implementation in Python would include speeding up the algorithm (Test PC specs: 4C/8T Ryzen, GTX 1660Ti Max-Q, 16GB RAM) and making the application both more user friendly and more Pythonic. 

Further development in the creation of this will go into using Java to create a more robust, desktop application that can also load maps, mazes and other test cases to allow for more real-world implementation of the algorithm.
